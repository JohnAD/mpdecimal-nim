cdecimal
========

The cdecimal package is a fast drop-in replacement for the decimal module
in Python's standard library. Both modules provide complete implementations
of Mike Cowlishaw/IBM's General Decimal Arithmetic Specification.

This archive is identical to the mpdecimal package, except that library
tests and documentation have been removed.
